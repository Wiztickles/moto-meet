        <h4>Gear Up</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Wear full gear including helmet, jacket, pants, gloves and boots. ATGATT!</li>
            <li>We will cheerfully ask you to join us another time if you are not adequately prepped</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Maintain you bike</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Check tire pressures, chain slack, oil level, brakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Prepare for whatever</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Carry a flat kit, tow coverage, water, energy bar, visa card, cell phone.</li>
            <li>Don't forget your emergency info on your phone or on your person.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Arrive on time....</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>...and with a full tank</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Ride at your peace</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't try to keep up with faster riders. It's easy to get carried away in a group - Resist out-riding your skill in the moment, and leave room for the unexpected.</li>
            <li>We will always wait for you at the next turn.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Pass safely</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If passing a rider, try to be sure they know you're coming, and never pass on the right.</li>
            <li>The leader may pass slower vehicles, but you don't have to. We will always wait for you at the next turn.</li>
            <li>The leader may pass slower vehicles, but you don't have to. We will always wait for you at the next turn.</li>
            <li>If you do pass a car, keep going after the pass! The riders behind you need room to land safely also.</li>
            <li>Signal faster riders to pass you.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Be considerate and mindful...</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>...both for fellow riders and for others on the road. Give cyclists lots of room. Slow down in residential areas. We are ambassadors of the sport we love and we all need to get home safely.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Let the leader know...</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>... if you plan to leave early or take a different route.</li>
            <li>Help keep an eye out for those behind you</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Have Fun!</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>That's why we do it right? Relax and enjoy the ride.</li>
        </ul>
